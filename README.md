# Roulette Martingale Emulator
Just a fun little Martingale Method tracker.

## What is the Martingale Method?  
The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the gambler wins the stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. The strategy had the gambler double the bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. The martingale strategy has been applied to roulette as well, as the probability of hitting either red or black is close to 50%. 

## What does this tracker do?  
It (almost) emulates the bahviour of a roulette wheel to let you see just how likely (...or unlikely) it is that long streaks will occur and just how quick you can lose all your money in roulette!
